# 🧠 Talk2AI

**Talk2AI** is a smart, AI-powered automation tool built with **Next.js** that lets users interact with databases using **natural language** instead of complex queries.  
Simply type prompts like:

> “Show all users who published blogs”

and Talk2AI will automatically generate the corresponding database query, highlight it for review, and execute it safely — showing the results in a structured table.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Query Generation** – Automatically converts your prompt into a valid database query.
- 🔒 **Safe Execution Layer** – Only allows read-only operations (`find`, `aggregate`, `countDocuments`, etc.).
- 🗄️ **MongoDB Integration** – Connect your MongoDB database easily.
- ⚙️ **Future-Ready** – MySQL and other database support planned.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a **prompt** (e.g., “List top 10 blogs by views”).
2. AI converts the prompt into a valid **MongoDB query**.
3. The generated query is **highlighted** for the user.
4. User confirms and executes the query.
5. Results are fetched through a **secure read-only API** and displayed in a table.

## 🔒 Security

Talk2AI ensures all database operations are **read-only**.  
It blocks any write, update, or delete queries (e.g., `insertOne`, `updateMany`, `deleteOne`, etc.) — protecting your data while allowing exploration.

Allowed operations:
- `find()`
- `findOne()`
- `aggregate()`
- `countDocuments()`
- `distinct()`
- `estimatedDocumentCount()`
